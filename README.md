We recommend using pnpm as your package manager, as it's faster and more efficient than npm or yarn. If you don't have pnpm installed, you can install it globally by running:

Installed with pnpm

```
npm install -g pnpm
```

To create a Next.js app, open your terminal, cd into the folder you'd like to keep your project, and run the following command:

```
npx create-next-app@latest nextjs-dashboard --example "https://github.com/vercel/next-learn/tree/main/dashboard/starter-example" --use-pnpm
```

<br>
Run pnpm i to install the project's packages.

```
pnpm i
```

<br>
Followed by pnpm dev to start the development server.

```
pnpm dev
```
